# Welcome

This folder is a small learning playground with short programs and a few data questions written as SQL. The goal is to practice everyday problem‑solving ideas, explain them in plain language, and show how numbers tell stories.

## What is inside

- **Short C++ programs** that print messages, do simple calculations, draw patterns, or summarize numbers.
- **Lab programs** that bundle multiple tasks into a menu and explore classic number puzzles.
- **SQL examples** that show how to describe data tables and ask questions about them.

Everything here is meant to be friendly and easy to read, even if you are new to programming.

## Plain‑language guide to the ideas

### Everyday math words used in the programs

- **Sum / Total**: adding numbers together to get one combined number.
- **Difference**: the result of subtracting one number from another.
- **Product**: the result of multiplication.
- **Quotient**: the result of dividing one number by another.
- **Remainder**: what is left after division when numbers do not split evenly.
- **Average (Mean)**: add all numbers, then divide by how many numbers there are.
- **Median**: the “middle” number after sorting; if there are two middles, average them.
- **Minimum / Maximum**: the smallest and largest values in a set.
- **Percentage / Rate**: “per 100,” often used to describe growth or interest.
- **Square**: a number multiplied by itself.
- **Factor**: a number that divides another number evenly.
- **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: the biggest number that divides two numbers evenly.
- **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: the smallest number that both numbers can divide into evenly.
- **Sequence**: a list of numbers that follow a rule (like Fibonacci).
- **Growth over time**: how a value changes from one step or year to the next.

### Friendly descriptions of what the programs do

- **Hello message**: prints a simple greeting so you can see a program run.
- **Sum and compare**: adds numbers, then compares them to see which is larger or smaller.
- **Averages**: reads several numbers and finds their mean.
- **Counting and repeating**: shows how to repeat an action many times (like printing a pattern).
- **Patterns and grids**: draws lines, triangles, or tables using repeated characters.
- **Calculator**: lets you choose a basic math operation and see the result.
- **Interest growth**: shows how money grows when a fixed percent is added each year.
- **Arrays (lists of numbers)**: keep several values together so they can be sorted or summarized.
- **Functions (helper recipes)**: small reusable steps that make the main task easier to read.
- **Menu programs**: offer choices, then run the selected task.
- **Fibonacci sequence**: each new number is the sum of the two before it.
- **Collatz steps**: if a number is even, cut it in half; if odd, multiply by three and add one.
- **Reverse numbers**: flips digits to show them in the opposite order.
- **Statistics storyteller**: summarizes a list of values with smallest, largest, average, and middle.

### SQL ideas explained without jargon

SQL is a way to ask questions about organized information. Think of it like a set of spreadsheets.

- **Table**: a sheet of information.
- **Row**: one line in the sheet (one record).
- **Column**: a vertical list of one kind of detail (like “price” or “name”).
- **Primary key**: a unique ID so each row can be told apart from the others.
- **Foreign key**: a link that connects one table to another.
- **Join**: matching rows from two tables by their shared IDs.
- **Filter**: picking only the rows you care about (for example, “only last month”).
- **Sort**: putting results in a helpful order (like highest to lowest).
- **Group**: collecting similar rows together (for example, all orders for each customer).
- **Count / Sum / Average**: basic ways to measure how big a group is.
- **Window calculation**: a way to compare each row to others nearby without losing the full list.
- **Common table expression (CTE)**: a named, temporary result you can reuse in a bigger query.
- **Recursive query**: a step‑by‑step search, like walking down a family tree.
- **Percentile**: a score that tells you how a value compares to the rest (the 90th percentile is higher than most values).

## How to explore

Open any file and read the comments at the top. They explain the purpose in simple words. If you want to experiment, try changing numbers and seeing how the results change. This is a safe place to learn by curiosity.
